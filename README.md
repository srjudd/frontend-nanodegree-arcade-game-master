<h1>About Play Frogger</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-master repo was downloaded from 
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
on December 24, 2014 by S. Renee Judd (rjudd@nl.edu).</p>
<p>The game was fleshed out in app.js with minimal changes to index.html, 
engine.js, and style.css. No changes were made to resources.js or to the 
existing image files. A dead princess version of the princess image was added 
to the image folder.</p>
<p>The game is run by launching index.html in a javascript-enabled browser. The 
game needs all the files in this repository with the exception of some extra 
game sprites in the images folder, which can be used by a developer in 
modifying or extending this game.</p>

<h2>The following additional resources were used.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Udacity courses OOJS and HTML5 Canvas provided direct models for code 
		added to this game, particularly prototype methods.</li>
	<li>Inspiration was provided by a number of student projects from cohort 1. 
		Particular games examined early in this project included:
		<ul>
			<li>http://dw-frogger.appspot.com</li>
			<li>http://victoria-front-enddev.github.io/Udacity-Project-3/</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Mozilla Development Network and W3C Schools provided wonderful syntax 
	examples for math, array, string, and object prototype methods. 
		<ul>
			<li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript</li>
			<li>http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Adobe FireWorks was used to analyze image sprites to provide canvas 
		coordinates and also to create the dead princess image by modifying a 
		provided sprite.</li>
	<li>Sublime Text 3 was the code editor used. Linting tools are still not 
		working for this developer.</li>
	<li>Chrome Developer Tools were used to test and debug code.
		Google JavaScript StyleGuide was followed to the best of the developer's 
		ability. 
		https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
		</li>
	<li>JS Doc was attempted using the following references:
		<ul>
			<li>http://usejsdoc.org/</li>
			<li>https://github.com/kimonolabs/JSDoc-Style-Guide</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>JS Beautifier was used to clean up formatting. http://jsbeautifier.org

</ul>
