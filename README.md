<h1>About Play Frogger</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-master repo was downloaded from 
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
on December 24, 2014 by S. Renee Judd (rjudd@nl.edu).</p>
<p>The game was fleshed out in app.js with minimal changes to index.html, 
engine.js, and style.css. No changes were made to resources.js or to the 
existing image files. A dead princess version of the princess image was added 
to the image folder.</p>
<p>The game is run by launching index.html in a javascript-enabled browser. The 
game needs all the files in this repository with the exception of some extra 
game sprites in the images folder, which can be used by a developer in 
modifying or extending this game.</p>
<p>The game can be played at the following site. <br>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The goal of this game is to earn points by moving the princess across the 
board so that she can jump into the water. The left, right, up, and down arrow 
keys will allow the princess to jump to the next tile in the chosen direction, 
if movement in that direction is possible. The princess must avoid the giant 
water bugs that move across the board; collision with a bug will cause the loss 
of a princess life. Gaining five points takes you to the next level of the 
game, with a bonus of five points and an additional life. An additional giant 
water bug joins the game when you level up.</p>
<p>The game ends when your princess runs out of lives. To replay,
reload the game page.</p>


<h2>The following additional resources were used.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Udacity courses OOJS and HTML5 Canvas provided direct models for code 
		added to this game, particularly prototype methods.</li>
	<li>Inspiration was provided by a number of student projects from cohort 1. 
		Particular games examined early in this project included:

	</li>
	<li>Mozilla Development Network and W3C Schools provided wonderful syntax 
	examples for math, array, string, and object prototype methods.

	<li>Adobe FireWorks was used to analyze image sprites to provide canvas 
		coordinates and also to create the dead princess image by modifying a 
		provided sprite.</li>
	<li>Sublime Text 3 was the code editor used. Linting tools are still not 
		working for this developer.</li>
	<li>Chrome Developer Tools were used to test and debug code.</li>
	<li>Google JavaScript StyleGuide was followed to the best of the developer's 
		ability. <a href=
